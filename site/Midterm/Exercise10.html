                <h1>BLACKPINK : Biggest Girlgroup Around The World</h1>
                <p>
                        <font size='4'>BLACKPINK (Korean: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group 
                            formed by YG Entertainment under the famous K-pop trainee system in South Korea, 
                            consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. the members auditioned with the entertainment agency 
                            to become students or 'trainees' with the hope of one day making their debut as a recording artist.
                            The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and 
                            "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard 
                            World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.<br><br>
                
                            "The meaning of BLACKPINK aims to contradict the common perception of the color pink," 
                            the statement read. "Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but BLACKPINK actually means to say that 
                            'Pretty isn’t everything.' It also symbolizes that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, 
                            but also great talent."</font>

                <h1>LASAGNA</h1>
                <p>
                        <font size='4'>Lasagna is by far the best Italian plate in the world, here is why. The taste of it is amazing there are many ways to describe it. 
                        Such as the cheesy warm goodness of the taste that makes it amazing. Also the salty pasta layers it has, and can also add hot 
                        sauce to give it a little spice. Not to mention the look of the plate. The brown meat and the red tomato
                        sauce looks mouth watering to anyone who has taste buds.<br>
                        <br>
                        You know its fresh out the oven when the steam comes straight out when you cut apiece off. The smell is the best smell in the world.
                        The briny sauce and pasta combination it gives makes it smell fresh. The meat and cheese also have a good combo make it tasty to look forward to.
                        The feel of the lasagna. It is soft and saucy when preparing it from scratch. The Pasta and cheese melts the cheese to make it feel smooth and the
                        slippery pasta when you cant pick it with a fork. Last but not least the sound of the best plate in the world being made. Its yet silent but you can
                        hear the sizzle of the platter. And when it is being served the squishy sound it makes when you chew it up.</font>

                <h1>INDIE POP</h1>
                <p>
                    <font size='4'> Independent music (often referred to as indie music or indie) is music produced independently from commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing.<br>
                        <br>
                        Indie rock's more melodic, less noisy, and relatively angst-free counterpart, Indie Pop reflects the underground's softer, sweeter side, with a greater 
                        emphasis on harmonies, arrangements, and songcraft. Encompassing everything from the lush orchestration of chamber pop 
                        to the primitive simplicity of twee pop, its focus is nevertheless more on the songs than on the sound, and although 
                        both indie pop and indie rock embrace the D.I.Y. spirit of punk, the former rejects punk's nihilistic attitude and 
                        abrasive sonic approach.</font>
