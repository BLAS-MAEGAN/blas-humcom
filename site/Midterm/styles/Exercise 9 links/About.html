        <h3><font size="6">BLACKPINK:Biggest Girlgroup Around The World</font></h3><br><br>
        <font size='4'>BLACKPINK (Korean: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group 
            formed by YG Entertainment under the famous K-pop trainee system in South Korea, 
            consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. the members auditioned with the entertainment agency 
            to become students or 'trainees' with the hope of one day making their debut as a recording artist.
            The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and 
            "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard 
            World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.<br><br>

            "The meaning of BLACKPINK aims to contradict the common perception of the color pink," 
            the statement read. "Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but BLACKPINK actually means to say that 
            'Pretty isn’t everything.' It also symbolizes that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, 
            but also great talent."<br><br>

            Kim Jisoo, the oldest member of the group, is a singer, often referred to as "adorable" by BLINKs (the official name of Blackpink fans). 
            She's known her steadiness and composure — and for balancing random objects on her head or shoulders — 
            previous videos showed her with a cup or an award on her head. Jisoo acted in commercials prior to Blackpink, 
            and was recently announced as a star of the new drama Snowdrop. Although she is the only member who does not 
            speak English fluently, the singer speaks Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.<br><br>

            It’s taken just four years for Blackpink to become one of the biggest girl bands in the world, with members Jennie, 
            Jisoo, Rosé and Lisa continuing to smash new records and forge new ground. They were the first K-pop girl group to play at Coachella 
            and to reach 1bn YouTube views — now they’re the most-subscribed-to music group on the platform — as well as being the first girl 
            group from any country to feature on Forbes Asia’s 30 Under 30 list. <br><br>
            
            In 2019, they broke three Guinness World Records with the single 
            Kill This Love, which has had more than 312m plays on Spotify 
            and over 824m YouTube views — a mere fraction of the quartet’s billions of streams, downloads, views and followers. 
            That same year they also undertook the most financially successful concert tour by a Korean female group. They’re front-row fixtures 
            at runway shows and the faces of mega brands including Chanel, Puma, Louis Vuitton and Dior.<br><br>
